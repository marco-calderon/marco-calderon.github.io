![Overview](/headless-wp-nextjs/1.jpg)

This project was born with the updated requirements of clients of using headless CMS technologies such as Wordpress, Woocomerce, Magento, Shopify, etc. This is just a blog sample that shows just that the integration between CMS is possible with modern technologies and my capabilities cover this requirement as well. With usage of TailwindCSS, GraphQL and rehype libraries for HTML transformation the integration with Wordpress blog posts was possible.

![Overview](/scriptsquare-nodejs-nextjs/1.jpg)

This web application is currently an MVP being developed that consist of a platform that helps writers and producers can collaborate, publish competitions, manage projects related to the movie, series and game industry, and find professional contracts that could help materialize their ideas.

This platform initially was made in Angular and Node.js but the stack changed to Node.js with Nest.js and React with Next.js. This is the first production project which implements a SSR technology and provides it with an excellent performance for searching and data management features.

All the stack was made from scratch including the credentials and authentication management, their database structure and the frontend implementation.

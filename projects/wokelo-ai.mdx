I worked with the DataCreek company to deliver the frontend part of their AI application called Wokelo. They offer company insights by researching in different sources and by compiling the information into a document that could be PDF or Microsoft Word.

It is an interesting project in which I worked with their development team to deliver a great integration between the backend and the frontend. I also suggested some changes that improved the performance of the application while I  was developing the frontend side.

I was also in charge of developing their landing page from their design. It works with mobile, tablet and desktop versions properly, with some background effects that were around some of the sections.

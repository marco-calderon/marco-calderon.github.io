A sample project that showcase the usage of Firebase and its Storage integration. This project was made using Next.js technology stack along with Firebase. On its styling solution I used emotion library for having a better performance and a themable solution for light and dark options.

While this project can support authentication, due to its simplicity and out of scope it was left for future development and instead I focused on storing the information into a Firebase bucket. This is later retrieved in the home page to show the user their uploaded files.

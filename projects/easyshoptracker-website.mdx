In addition to the web application I also was in charge of implementing the new redesign of the EasyShopTracker website. For this task I used Next.js with TailwindCSS to rapid development while having a great performance on first loads. I took the time to implement basic animations with Framer Motion that were present in the initial design.

There was no backend integration at this time but it required some adjustments on the background images as shown in the last screenshot. This was a challenge since the mobile version was also required to work with the layout changes and with the background images. Other complication here was the usage of custom components to give some interactivity while the user hovered the navigation bar.

Here are some videos that demonstrate the navigation bar behavior on both desktop and mobile versions.

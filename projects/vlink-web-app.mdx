This project consist on link sharing in real time for your devices and with other people using Vaults. It is an improved version of the Link Sharing web application with sharing capabilities and with newer technologies integrated into it.

This is a demonstration of the usage of Supabase inside a Next.js project which can provide a great user experience while maintaining a minimalist code base with the best practices to develop and test.

It automatically takes screenshots of the websites you share and uploads them into Cloudinary. The backend (using serverless functions) provides this functionality connecting another service from taking the screenshot and sending back to the calling function. It is a sample of a microservice architecture with separation of concerns in mind.

For the user experience I added some animations using Framer Motion library and also provide a mobile version so you can share the links on the go. The user can also navigate on your old saved links on the right pane.

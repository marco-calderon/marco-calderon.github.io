![Overview](/odyssey-strapi-vue/1.jpg)

This is the first sample project in which I demonstrate how I can implement beautiful interfaces using Vue and TailwindCSS. I also integrate Strapi CMS as the backend to manage all the information through a GraphQL endpoint. It also supports both dark and light themes.

E-commerce is always evolving in its styling solutions and migrates complex backend infrastructure into headless CMS technologies - that's why I explore and integrate these kind of technologies into my frontend skillset.

The reason I used Vue instead of React or Angular in this project is to show that for myself I can manage to work with the frontend mindset, by configuring internal states through a store, manage data interactions between a backend and still maintaining a great performance on the apps I develop.

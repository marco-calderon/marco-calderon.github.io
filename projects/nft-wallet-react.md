![Overview](/nft-wallet/1.jpg)

This was a short project in which I collaborated with a frontend team for solving issues for a MVP. This was for an NFT wallet for managing all NFT a user uploads into their system. It is a React web application that was responsive and included the best practices for a better performance and for allowing collaboration with a large team of developers.

The company that had this idea and worked for is [PrimeLab](https://primelab.io/) as a frontend lead role. My main tasks included requirements gathering, tasks creation, task management and actual develop using React. The backend and endpoints were already provided so my work was mainly focused on integration and component creation from a given Figma design.

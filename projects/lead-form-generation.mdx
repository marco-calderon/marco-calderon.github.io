This project consisted on creating a form lead generation for their potential customers for Bilt Renovation company. This company works in building and renovation in the UK and required an implementation of a design into a fully functional form funnel that will guide users to provide their contact information and renovation plans.

The selected implementation and technology was firstly by using React and TailwindCSS for giving quick turnarounds and for the short deadlines of this project. Later on was required to migrate this into a Next.js application with some backend integration. The chosen technology for backend was Node.js with the JavaScript serverless functions that Next.js provides.

It integrates a session mechanism along with saving the form on each step of the form, so the user can later continue with it in another moment. On the other hand, animations were applied using Framer motion for the changes between the routes.

It introduced some complexity when the form was divided into steps. A combination between stores and a form management was required to provide the data saving functionality along with a proper backend communication.

Here Django and Bootstrap were used for showing the information using Django Templates. Also a combination of exposed REST APIs was used for displaying the information in async manner and to have results fast. A PostgreSQL database was employed as the persistence layer.

For the front end, jQuery AJAX requests are made to obtain the data and display them in charts and tables. It also handles the interaction for buying/selling products, add them in a shopping cart, and display the insights information.

There are pages that are available for type of user (admin, customer, client) and shows different optionsp according to their role and permissions.

This application is divided in three sections: Admin users have the privileges for editing the state of the shipment, the payment information, manage other users, revoke permissions, etc.; Customers can upload new products, change the state of the shipment, payment information, stock, and receive insights of their sales; Clients are the end consumers that buy the products from the customers, and have the ability to check the state of the shipment and payment.

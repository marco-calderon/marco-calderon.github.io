![Overview](/grpvyn-automation-react/2.jpg)

Grpvyn is an application that helps people save money while ordering food online by seraching the best deals among different delivery platforms. This could save money to both sides, the users and the restaurants.

My role in this project was to develop the automation part in which the user selects their food on the Grpvyn site and the ordering on user's behalf. This was made using Node.js scrapers on top of Playwright automation library. My tasks also included development of a backend server that handle the incoming food order requests, obtain information from the database and also present it in a user friendly way on a React web application for the automation tool. It helps the maintainers to perform orders at will and configure parameters.

Other tasks includes development of automated scrapers that obtain information from restaurant menus inside different delivery apps, process them and save the information gathered into a database. I worked alongside the CTO and the CEO to have an MVP ready and functional, which provided insights and had an active role in the development of new features and automated tasks creation.

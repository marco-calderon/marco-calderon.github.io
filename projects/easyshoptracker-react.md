This application helps people in the automotive repair industry to manage inventory of their inputs, handle easily the prices and providers and perform several account and services management with people, allowing them to schedule their work with its users. 

This project was developed in React with the usage of state management libraries such as Redux and Redux Saga to perform side effects. The backend was already being developed using PHP endpoints.

Some aspects related to the functionality of the frontend were adjusted to work with data management such as the invoice module. Inside it some components were developed to save their internal state to handle the user parts and services selection, so once the invoice was saved the information was sent in the format the backend required. This is important to mention since this module increased the complexity of the state of the application and in some cases it was challenging to support different kinds of data.

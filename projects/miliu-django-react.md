![Overview](/miliu-django-react/1.jpg)

I worked along a backend developer for a creation for a MVP. This is a platform to help producers and directors manage people related to the movie and series production area - photographers, cameraman, script writers, and managed the information, dates and places in which they can coordinate efforts and timeframes.

This product was developed using Django and REST Django Framework for providing the endpoints, and in the frontend the implementation was in React. With performance in mind, it helped the display of information in a very visual way so producers and directors can focus more on their work while having their people coordinated and communicated.

Originally this work began with the implementation of a calendar JS library but in the long run more work came in and even the implementation of a mobile version was required.

I developed a website for a company that works in the quantum industry, it helps scientific research in the development of quantum applications by providing skilled professionals to work on their requirements.

My work here was to implement a full stack application with some serverless functions in AWS Lambda that communicates to a DynamoDB database for retrieving information such as for the open positions section. The frontend part was developed using React and TailwindCSS.

Their page alone posed some major constraints and challenges. Their responsive behavior was indeed difficult to implement since their layouts were complex to adapt to their screen size.

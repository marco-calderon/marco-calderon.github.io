IT Portal is a web application for asset management from an IT perspective, from computers to files and routers, while allowing to save credentials per device and also allow to save connection features for remote management.

It is an interesting tool that integrates several third party services for data management and asset securitization, for example DattoCMS and Azure. The platform works with performance in mind, so a well-defined REST API is in charge of managing all the incoming requests and the heavy loads that they could handle.

My role in this company was to provide connections with external services in the frontend part using Angular, product maintenance tasks and overall improvements of their application. Being completely honest this was a complex job even with my experience since their existing codebase was not improved in some parts and had flaws that led to unexpected bugs in the app. The bundle sizes were also big as well, they we're not optimized to handle big loads of information and worked along with the CTO to get this improved.

I also worked with backend developers to collaborate in the creation of endpoints that could handle a better way to interchange information - this way having a performance increase in both sides.
